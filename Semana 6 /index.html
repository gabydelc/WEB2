<p> Started with a wake 'n bake, Said we feel alright, Got to hit the road soon, Got my show tonight, So come on, Lets get it right now, So come on, Lets get inside now, So come on, Started with a wake 'n bake, Said we feel alright.
The lines roll by as I sit and sigh, Why they spark the flame, We ain't got no lou dog, But the van still smells the same, So come on, Lets get it right now, So come on, Lets get inside now, Everything will be alright, Once we spark the flame.
I feel so good tonight, Said me feel alright, I don't think I'll get to sleep before first light, So come on, Lets get it right now, So come on, Lets get inside now, So come on, Hanging with the friends tonight, Said we feel alright.
Now just a little wake 'n bake, Said we feel alright, Got to hit the road soon, Got my show tonight, So come on, Lets get right now, So come on, Lets get inside now, So come on, Come on, Come on, Come on, Here comes the sun, The strawberry fields, The joker, The smoker, The midnight toker, And its all all right all of us, Lets take a little ride on the magic bus, So come on, Lets get it right now, So come on, Lets get inside now, So come on, Started with a wake 'n bake, Said we feel alright.
